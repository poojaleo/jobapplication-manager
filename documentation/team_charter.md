qualities:

### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or
  embarrassed?**
    Be open to others' opinions. Communicate and share thoughts actively. 
    Ask lots of questions. Be open to learning new skills.  
    We are all here to learn. Help each other! Have a learning mindset.
    Listening skills. Disagree with the idea, not the person. Have healthy
    conversations around disagreements. 

  * **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
      Communicating early. Don't move forward until the situation is resolved. 
      Culture of celebrating wins to balance out any constructive feedback.
      Be gentle with eachother. This is not a competition, we are all here as learners.
When voicing concerns, using non-violent communication.
    

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
    Pre-planning to set up for success. Pacing ourselves.
    Making clear, small tasks. Asking for clarification before we start.
    Setting up regular check-in to discuss and assign next tasks, discuss blockers.
    Establishing clear deadlines and expectations. Having good documentation.

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
    Communicate early - what blockers are stopping progress. Ideally flag that
    a deadline is not on track early. We may need to resolve as a team.
    This may be because a task is larger than we anticipated. The deadline
    may not be realistic. 
   

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
    Documentation! Trello. Keeping both up to date. Giving clear specific feedback.
    Make the tasks specific, measurable, etc. (SMART).
