[George] - [JobSmarter] Accomplishment Tracking

Background
It's a great habit to record accomplishments and progress throughout your SDE career. It's useful to reflect on what you've worked on in the past and comes in handy during performance reviews and promotion cycles.

Instructions
Save a copy of this document in your “private” folder.

Using the below template, keep track of what you’ve worked on each week during the unit. 1-3 bullets under each section for each week should suffice. This should only take 5 - 10 minutes of reflection each week.

As you track your work, think about how it relates to the SDE fundamental skills laid out in the syllabus and how you are practicing them.

Converts a design into code and delivers it using best practices
Writes secure, testable, maintainable code
Understands when to use (or not) a broad range of data structures and algorithms
Creates unit tests that thoroughly test functionality
Troubleshoots by debugging and reviewing errors, logfiles, and metrics
Contributes to planning and design
Escalates when projects hit roadblocks and risks
The important work samples don’t only include the things you authored, but should include things like key CRs you reviewed that you are proud of as well!

You will submit your completed Accomplishment Tracking Document to your instructors by the end of the unit.
