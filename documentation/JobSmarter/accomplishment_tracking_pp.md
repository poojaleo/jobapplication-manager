[Pooja Patel] - [JobSmarter] Accomplishment Tracking
Each team member should have their own version of this document.

Background
It's a great habit to record accomplishments and progress throughout your SDE career. It's useful to reflect on what you've worked on in the past and comes in handy during performance reviews and promotion cycles.

Instructions
Save a copy of this document in your “private” folder.

Using the below template, keep track of what you’ve worked on each week during the unit. 1-3 bullets under each section for each week should suffice. This should only take 5 - 10 minutes of reflection each week.

As you track your work, think about how it relates to the SDE fundamental skills laid out in the syllabus and how you are practicing them.

Converts a design into code and delivers it using best practices
Writes secure, testable, maintainable code
Understands when to use (or not) a broad range of data structures and algorithms
Creates unit tests that thoroughly test functionality
Troubleshoots by debugging and reviewing errors, logfiles, and metrics
Contributes to planning and design
Escalates when projects hit roadblocks and risks
The important work samples don’t only include the things you authored, but should include things like key CRs you reviewed that you are proud of as well!

You will submit your completed Accomplishment Tracking Document to your instructors by the end of the unit.

Week 1
Goals: Come up with an idea for an application and write a concise and structured design document 
outlining the problem statement, user stories and in-scope and out-scope features.

Activity: Brainstorming ideas, completing the design document, develop code and style
guidelines to be followed, creating a team charter


Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews: Design document, Sequence diagrams, Entity-Relationship Diagram, 
Wireframing UX design, Team rubric document.

Things learned: Having a clear understanding of what the job application should comprise of, 
made our future work easier where we could easily divide the tasks by creating user stories and each individual
working on the assigned story.

Week 2
Goals: Java Backend code, Testing (Mockito), AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway

Activity: Created 3 models - Users, Job Application and Questions, LambdaActivityProvider classes to interact with AWS lambda
with corresponding Requests and Response classes for each API end point.

Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews: Cloudformation queries to create DynamoDB tables and GSI tables, Unit testing to ensure code coverage.

Things learned: Having work clearly divided and effective collaboration can help with minimum merge conflicts. 
Design documents created in 1st week ensured everyone uses defined class and variable names to annotate the POJO classes. 
Testing is key and as we keep on developuing and working on the code, it should not impact or break the code which is already written.

Week 3
Goals: Frontend website to let users interact with backend API endpoints

Activity: Creating framework and setting up components in React, Creating additional GSI endpoints for users to sort/filter the results.

Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews: Installing the required dependencies for the react application to work.

Things learned: React, Bootstrap frameworks. 

Week 4
Goals: Hosting our website, Changes to design document, Preparing the presentation

Activity: leaning about CORS and how to handle such errors, Minimizing frontend bugs.

Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews: Passing variables when navigating from one page to another in React, 
Ability to add question to job application.

Things learned: How a code behaves differently on local maching vs hosting it on a platform, 
even with in AWS Amplify, netlify and S3 we could observe some changes and how the same code behaves differently 
on each site.
